The raw data set can be found in the folder "raw" and filenames are in the format of gridwatch_year.csv e.g. gridwatch_2012.csv. Each file contains three columns.

Variable description and units:

The following data sets can be found in the "processed" folder and were created from the raw data described above.

gridwatch_merge.csv : This is all of the raw csv files merged into one. It was four columns: filename, id,                              timestamp and demand
